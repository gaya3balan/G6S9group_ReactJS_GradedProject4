Instructions for Running React Graded Project

1. Go to github : https://github.com/gaya3balan/G6S9_ReactJS_GradedProject4 and Download zip
2. Open project in VS CODE and open a terminal for client-> React-Graded-Project\client\movies-on-the-tip --> npm install 
3. Open a terminal for server React-Graded-Project\server --> npm install json-server
node_modules should now be created in both client\movies-on-the-tip and server 
4. Do npm start for terminal associated with server
5. Do npm start for terminal associated with client 

This should work as I verified after uploading to git. Please check video as well- we performed these steps from scratch.


If still not working due to some reason- please download full zip with node_modules from
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GIvoUVnoeUB1Gp8UQwNCvFHi2pLnlOoD

This will work 100%. 

Thanks
